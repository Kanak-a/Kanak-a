# 👋 Yo, I’m Kanaka

AI & DS Engineer in the making — coding things that *listen*, *think*, and sometimes *judge your interview answers*. ✨

### Currently Building
- 🧠 Timeless Wisdom, Modern Life — A quote-based guidance app that uses LLMs to explain ancient philosophical quotes based on user moods. (LLMs, prompt engineering, PostgreSQL, React)
- 🧪 Researching how to make machines give helpful criticism without sounding like your passive-aggressive uncle.

### ⚒️ Toolbox of Doom
`Python` | `FastAPI` | `PyTorch` | `React` | `MongoDB` | `Git`  
Also: scraping data, structuring chaos, and tweaking LLM prompts until they stop hallucinating.

### 📚 Currently Deep Diving Into:
- 🧬 Advanced ML & DL techniques
